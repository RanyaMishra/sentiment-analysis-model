Humans ourselves are not able to understand how exactly language is processed by our brains. So, is it possible for us to teach a machine to learn our language?? Yes, through extensive research, a lot of methods have been developed that could help machines understand our languages. NLP or Natural Language Processing is the field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers. One subproblem of NLP is sentiment analysis, i.e classifying a statement as positive or negative. What is the use of classifying a statement as positive or negative??

 Let’s take an example of Amazon website. On Amazon, it’s users can leave a comment about a product stating whether it was good, bad or it could even be neutral. Now, using a human to read all the comments and obtaining the overall customer feedback on the product would be expensive and time-consuming. Enter our machine learning model. The machine learning model can churn through a vast amount of data, making inferences and classifying the comment. Using this ML model, Amazon can better its products through the customer reviews which would bring in more revenue for the company.
